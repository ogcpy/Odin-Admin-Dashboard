## Steps to Complete  

### Step 1: Set Up and Planning  
1. Set up a Git repository and initialize your project files.  
2. Create the basic structure with `HTML` and link your `CSS` file.  
3. Review the provided design file to plan your layout and structure.  

### Step 2: Layout  
1. Write HTML for the **sidebar**, **header**, and **main-content** containers.  
2. Use **CSS Grid** properties to arrange the basic layout.  

### Step 3: Nesting  
1. Inside each parent container, add child elements using nested grids.  
   - Sidebar: Lay out navigation and branding.  
   - Header: Arrange the search bar, user info, and action buttons.  
   - Main Content: Organize projects, announcements, and trending items.  
2. Use placeholder content and images to position grid items.  

### Step 4: Gather Assets  
1. Choose colors from [Tailwind CSS Palettes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).  
2. Download icons as SVGs from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).  
3. Use **Google Fonts** (e.g., Roboto) for typography.  

### Step 5: Tips and Tricks  
- Use background colors or borders to visualize your grid during development.  
- Experiment with `px`, `fr`, or a combination for grid tracks.  
- While not required, consider adding responsive design to practice media queries.  
- Push the project to **GitHub** and publish it with **GitHub Pages**.
